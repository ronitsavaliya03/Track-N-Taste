# Railway Ticket Booking System

## Overview
This Java-based Railway Ticket Booking System allows users to book train tickets, manage train details, and allocate seats dynamically. It follows object-oriented programming principles such as:
- **Inheritance** (Coach subclasses for different types of coaches)
- **Abstraction** (Abstract class `Coach` to define common functionality)
- **Encapsulation** (Private fields with public getter methods)

## Features
- **Train and Coach Management**: Add multiple trains and coach types dynamically.
- **Coach Types**: Sleeper, 3-Tier AC, 2-Tier AC, 1st Class AC.
- **Seat Allocation**: Dynamically allocates available seats to passengers.
- **Fare Calculation**: Calculates ticket price based on distance and coach type.
- **PNR Generation**: Generates a unique PNR for each booked ticket.
- **Train Availability Display**: Shows available trains and seat availability.

## Technologies Used
- **Core Java**
- **Java Collections Framework (List, Map, ArrayList, HashMap)**
- **Scanner Class for User Input**
